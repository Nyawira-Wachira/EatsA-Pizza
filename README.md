## Description
EatsA Pizza web application is created in such a way that it enables users to order the size of pizza they want, the type of toppings they prefer
and the type of crust they want. The application also shows the price of each size of pizza, topping and crust. With the click of the order button,
it displays the customer's order and the price. It also allows the users to make as many orders as they want and calculates the total cost of all the
orders, with a summary of the entire order. It also has a feature that enables users to choose how to receive their order; whether a delivery to 
a specific location or not and an alert that confirms the delivery to be made.
